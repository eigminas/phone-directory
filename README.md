This is an old project that was part of the coursework at university in my first stage as computer science student.
The purpose of this project was to learn more about creting and implementing interfaces in java as well as to play with
different data structures including arrays, linked lists, and hashes.

In this project, I also created a basic GUI to test program instead of running it in the console.
